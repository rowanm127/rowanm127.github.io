When slavery was abolished, Gladstone benefited heavily from his father's position as well as his own by seeking financial compensation for slave owners. However, after seemingly having a small change of heart, he spent the latter part of his career attempting to uphold the rights of non-Europeans and reduce the use of slave workers.",

                description: "A writer and poet who celebrated British imperialism in his work. At the time Kipling was writing, many saw the Empire as a force for good, creating stability, order and unity. Retrospectively, looking up to the Empire in this way seems incomprehensible, and even those in the early 20th century thought Kipling’s views of imperialism often strayed too far. However, his peers could not deny his skill as a writer, and he was defended by many of them despite his strong and often racist opinions.",
